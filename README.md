- Consolidates 18 months of subscriber, usage, ARPU, and complaint data (~120k records) into a single Excel model using Power Query.
- Tracks churn rate, revenue-at-risk (BDT 42M+ monthly), and top churn drivers with slicers for prepaid/postpaid, tenure cohorts, and regions.
- Flags high-risk segments (e.g., tenure < 90 days, ARPU < BDT 250) and models retention lift scenarios (1.8pp churn reduction = BDT 6.5M recovered).
- Delivers executive-ready KPI cards (NPS, complaint SLA, device mix) with drill-through pivot views for quick root-cause analysis.
